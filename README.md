# SortingVisualized

## sortingvisualized.py:

This file contains several sorting algorithms and the pygame methods used to display them in a separate window where the list is represented as bars where the bars height is the integer at that index. The list consists of the numbers 5 to 400 since that is the range that fits the screen with the current bar width and margin between the bars. Each sorting function repeatedly calls the update() function which updates everything shown in the pygame window.

### Algorithms currently added:

- Gnome sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Coctail sort
